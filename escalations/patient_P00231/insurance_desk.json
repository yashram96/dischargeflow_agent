      "message": "Despite an approved pre-authorization for ₹500,000, the insurance has covered ₹0.00 of the ₹400,000 hospital bill. This leaves a patient balance of ₹350,000, which also shows a ₹50,000 discrepancy from the total bill minus insurance coverage (₹400,000 - ₹0.00 = ₹400,000, not ₹350,000). This indicates a significant issue preventing insurance payout and requires immediate investigation.",

Verify if all billed procedures align with the pre-authorization, check for any unstated deductibles, co-pays, or non-covered services, and clarify the calculation of the patient's final balance.",
