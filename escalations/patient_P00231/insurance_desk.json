      "message": "Despite an active policy, cashless coverage type, and an approved pre-authorization for ₹500,000.00 (which is greater than the total bill of ₹400,000.00), the 'Amount Covered by Insurance' is reported as ₹0.00. This indicates that the expected insurance coverage has not been applied to the bill, preventing a smooth discharge.",

Verify if all procedures billed align with the pre-authorized services and if any deductibles, co-pays, or non-covered services are impacting the claim.",
