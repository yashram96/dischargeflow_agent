      "message": "Despite an approved pre-authorization for ₹500,000, the insurance has reportedly covered ₹0.00 of the ₹400,000 hospital bill. However, the patient's balance is stated as ₹350,000, which is ₹50,000 less than the total bill if insurance covered nothing. This indicates a significant discrepancy in financial reporting or unstated adjustments/patient responsibility, preventing a clear financial discharge.",
      "suggested_action": "Urgently investigate the financial details. Clarify why the approved pre-authorization amount has not been applied to the bill. Determine the source of the ₹50,000 reduction from the total bill to the patient's balance. Verify all deductibles, co-pays, and the current claim processing status with Red Insurance.",
