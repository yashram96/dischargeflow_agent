      "message": "Despite an approved pre-authorization for ₹500,000 and sufficient annual limits, the insurance has covered ₹0.00 of the ₹400,000 hospital bill. This contradicts the expected cashless coverage based on the approved pre-authorization, leaving a significant patient balance of ₹350,000.",
      "suggested_action": "Immediately contact Red Insurance to investigate why the approved pre-authorization amount has not been applied to the bill. Clarify the reason for ₹0.00 coverage and the patient's balance. Verify if any deductibles, co-pays, non-covered services, or processing errors account for this discrepancy. Patient discharge cannot proceed from an insurance perspective until this is resolved.",
