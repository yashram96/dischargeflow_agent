Pre-authorization (PA-2024-00231) was approved for ₹500,000, and the total bill is ₹400,000. However, the 'Amount Covered by Insurance' is reported as ₹0.00, resulting in an outstanding patient balance of ₹350,000.\n-   This issue directly prevents financial clearance for discharge, despite sufficient pre-authorization limits.\n\nPending Items/Follow-up Required:\n-   Immediate contact with Red Insurance is required to investigate the 'INS_PARTIAL_COVERAGE' issue. This includes clarifying the reason for ₹0.00 coverage, checking for unapplied deductibles, co-pays, non-covered services, or claim processing errors.\n-   Discharge remains on HOLD until this financial discrepancy is fully resolved and clear financial responsibility is established."
