Although your insurance had approved a significant amount for your care, we've found that the hospital bill hasn't been covered as expected, leaving a substantial balance that your insurance should have handled. We are immediately contacting Red Insurance to investigate this discrepancy and understand why the payment hasn't been processed according to your pre-authorization. We cannot proceed with discharge until this critical insurance matter is clarified and resolved. We appreciate your patience as we work to fix this as quickly as possible.",

Despite an approved pre-authorization (PA-2024-00231) for ₹500,000 and a total hospital bill of ₹400,000, the insurance has covered ₹0.00, resulting in an unexpected patient balance of ₹350,000. This contradicts the anticipated cashless coverage and is classified under issue code INS_PARTIAL_COVERAGE. Immediate action is required: Red Insurance must be contacted to investigate this discrepancy, clarify the reason for ₹0.00 coverage, and reconcile the patient's balance. Verification for any deductibles, co-pays, non-covered services, or processing errors is crucial. Discharge cannot proceed until this critical financial barrier is resolved by Red Insurance."
